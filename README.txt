LogicMail for BlackBerry
------------------------

LogicMail is a standalone E-Mail client designed to run on RIM BlackBerry
handheld devices, providing full support for IMAP, POP, and SMTP over the
device's Internet connection. Its exists to provide an alternative to the
service-oriented "push" E-Mail system that is normally provided with the
device, which does not always meet the needs of conventional E-Mail service
users.

The initial inspiration for this project came from the now defunct Mail4ME
project, with continued inspiration from all of its active users.
