LogicMail for BlackBerry
------------------------

LogicMail is a J2ME E-Mail client supporting IMAP and POP, and designed to run
on RIM BlackBerry handheld devices. Its goal is to provide an alternative to
the service-oriented "push" E-Mail system that the device normally provides,
so we can also use our conventional E-Mail services. The inspiration for this
project came from the now defunct Mail4ME project, as well as some of the
initial protocol code.
