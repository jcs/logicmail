/**
 * Is the abstract base class for socket connections used inside the SMTP,
 * POP3 and IMAP protocols of the mail package. The rationale for using this class
 * is the difference in how networking is handled in J2ME and J2SE: While J2SE
 * has java.net.Socket, J2ME uses the Generic Connection Framework with its
 * javax.io.Connector class as a central means to open sockets or HTTP
 * connection. Unfortunately, both methods are totally incompatible with each
 * other, so a common abstraction has to be found to make the mail package
 * work in both environments.
 * <p>
 * The Connection class is such an abstraction. It provides abstract
 * versions of methods that open and close sockets, read from them and write
 * to them. It also provides a static factory method that is able to instantiate
 * one of several sub-classes of Connection that match the different run-time
 * environments. These sub-classes are all called ConnectionImpl, and they are
 * loaded "by name" from the j2me, j2se, or http packages, respectively. This
 * is the only way to get rid of compile-time dependencies on these classes.

         * characters belonging to a line were read. The result was
         * a high level of heap fragmentation, which made applications

         * in a buffer of fixed size that is large enough to hold a
         * "normal" line belonging to an e-mail. When a terminator
         * is found, a new String object is created from that buffer.
         * Since the buffer is of fixed size and used during the whole
         * lifetime of the Connection object, and the String is the
         * actual String that makes it into the final Message object,
         * there are no temporary Strings needed -- at least not in the
         * common case: If a mail server tends to send whole messages
         * without line terminators (and thus disregards for example
         * the POP3 specification that dictates a maximum response of
         * 512 characters), temporary Strings will again be necessary,
