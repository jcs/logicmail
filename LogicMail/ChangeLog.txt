	* Changed configuration serialization from the original simple format
        into a serialized hashtable format.
        : This will break all existing stored configurations, but should limit
        : breakage due to future changes of the configuration parameters.
        : The simpler format had a side-effect of breaking stored configurations
        : with every single change.

	* IMAP: Fixed a bug with empty folders
	* IMAP: Implemented rudimentary NAMESPACE support to make it possible to
        fix a compatability issue with Dovecot IMAP servers.
	: This implementation only uses the NAMESPACE results, if available,
	: to handle the case where the server pretends the INBOX has no subfolders.
	* IMAP: Fixed a parsing bug which occured when the E-Mail subject
	contains a single '"' character
