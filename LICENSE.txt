 This file is a modified version of the one covered by the license below.
 The modifications involved changes in the public interface, general
 formatting, and size reduction.
 While the RIM API includes an MD5Digest class, it requires a digitally signed
 binary to be usable.  Since requiring code signing would impose an undesirable
 restriction on this project, this alternative implementation is provided.

 Fast implementation of RSA's MD5 hash generator in Java JDK Beta-2 or higher.

 This was originally a rather straight re-implementation of the reference
 implementation given in RFC1321 by RSA. It passes the MD5 test suite as
 defined in RFC1321.

 Many optimizations made by Timothy W Macinta. Reduced time to checksum a test
 file in Java alone to roughly half the time taken compared with
 java.security.MessageDigest (within an intepretter). Also added an optional
 native method to reduce the time even further. See
 http://www.twmacinta.com/myjava/fast_md5.php for further information on the
 time improvements achieved.

 Some bug fixes also made by Timothy W Macinta.

 This Java class has been derived from the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5
 Message-Digest Algorithm and its reference implementation.

 This file is a modified version of the one covered by the comments below.
 The modifications involved removing unused functionality and general formatting.
 While the BB v4.1 API includes a Base64 encoder and decoder, the v4.0 API does
 not.  This class exists to provide support for BB v4.0 devices.
